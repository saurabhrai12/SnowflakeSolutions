# ❄️ Snowflake Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

Unlike traditional databases, Snowflake doesn't use traditional indexes. Instead, it uses several advanced techniques for performance optimization that are automatically managed and more efficient for cloud-scale analytics.

## 🚫 What Snowflake DOESN'T Use

### Traditional Indexes
- **B-tree indexes**: Not needed due to columnar storage
- **Bitmap indexes**: Replaced by automatic micro-partitioning
- **Hash indexes**: Not applicable in Snowflake's architecture
- **Composite indexes**: Replaced by clustering keys

## ✅ What Snowflake USES Instead

### 1. **Automatic Micro-Partitioning**
```sql
-- Snowflake automatically partitions data into micro-partitions (50-500MB)
-- No configuration needed - happens automatically
-- Metadata tracks min/max values for efficient pruning
```

### 2. **Clustering Keys** (Our Implementation)
```sql
-- Equivalent to "smart indexing" for large tables
ALTER TABLE orders CLUSTER BY (customer_id, order_date);
ALTER TABLE products CLUSTER BY (category, is_active);
ALTER TABLE customers CLUSTER BY (customer_tier, is_active);
```

### 3. **Search Optimization Service**
```sql
-- For point lookups and small result sets
ALTER TABLE customers ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;
ALTER TABLE products ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;
```

### 4. **Columnar Storage**
- Data stored in columns, not rows
- Perfect for analytics workloads
- Automatic compression and encoding

## 🎯 Our Optimization Strategy

### Table-by-Table Optimization

#### **Jobs Table**
```sql
-- Clustered for job monitoring and time-based queries
ALTER TABLE jobs CLUSTER BY (status, created_at);
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;
```
**Benefits:**
- Fast filtering by job status
- Efficient time-series analysis
- Quick job_id lookups

#### **Customers Table**
```sql
-- Clustered for customer segmentation
ALTER TABLE customers CLUSTER BY (customer_tier, is_active);
ALTER TABLE customers ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;
```
**Benefits:**
- Fast customer tier analysis
- Efficient active/inactive filtering
- Quick email-based lookups

#### **Products Table**
```sql
-- Clustered for catalog queries
ALTER TABLE products CLUSTER BY (category, is_active);
ALTER TABLE products ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;
```
**Benefits:**
- Fast category-based filtering
- Efficient active product queries
- Quick product name/ID searches

#### **Orders Table**
```sql
-- Clustered for customer analysis and time-series
ALTER TABLE orders CLUSTER BY (customer_id, order_date);
```
**Benefits:**
- Fast customer order history
- Efficient date range queries
- Optimal for customer analytics

#### **Order Items Table**
```sql
-- Clustered for join performance
ALTER TABLE order_items CLUSTER BY (order_id);
```
**Benefits:**
- Fast order detail retrieval
- Efficient order-to-items joins
- Optimal for order analysis

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Check Clustering Information
```sql
-- Check clustering depth (lower is better)
SELECT 
    table_name,
    clustering_key,
    total_partition_count,
    average_depth,
    average_overlaps
FROM information_schema.automatic_clustering_history
WHERE table_name IN ('JOBS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDERS', 'ORDER_ITEMS')
ORDER BY end_time DESC;
```

### Monitor Search Optimization
```sql
-- Check search optimization status
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%' IN SCHEMA raw_data;

-- Check search optimization usage
SELECT *
FROM information_schema.search_optimization_history
WHERE table_name IN ('JOBS', 'CUSTOMERS', 'PRODUCTS')
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```

### Query Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Analyze query performance
SELECT 
    query_id,
    query_text,
    execution_time,
    warehouse_size,
    partitions_scanned,
    partitions_total,
    bytes_scanned
FROM information_schema.query_history
WHERE execution_time > 10000  -- queries taking more than 10 seconds
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚀 Performance Best Practices

### 1. **Query Optimization**

#### ✅ Good Practices
```sql
-- Use clustering key columns in WHERE clauses
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id = 'CUST001' 
AND order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Leverage automatic partitioning
SELECT * FROM jobs 
WHERE status = 'PENDING' 
AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE() - 7;

-- Use appropriate data types
SELECT customer_id, total_amount::NUMBER(12,2)
FROM orders;
```

#### ❌ Avoid These
```sql
-- Don't use functions on clustering key columns
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024;  -- BAD

-- Use this instead:
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' 
AND order_date < '2025-01-01';  -- GOOD
```

### 2. **Warehouse Sizing**

#### Our Warehouse Strategy
```sql
-- analytics_wh sizing based on workload
-- SMALL: Development and light analytics
-- MEDIUM: Production analytics and reporting
-- LARGE: Heavy ETL and complex analytics

-- Auto-suspend and auto-resume configured
-- Scales based on query complexity
```

### 3. **Data Loading Optimization**

#### Bulk Loading Best Practices
```sql
-- Use COPY INTO for bulk loads
COPY INTO customers
FROM @my_stage/customers.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' SKIP_HEADER = 1);

-- Use clustering hints for large loads
ALTER TABLE customers SUSPEND RECLUSTER;
-- Load data
ALTER TABLE customers RESUME RECLUSTER;
```

### 4. **Join Optimization**

#### Optimized Join Patterns
```sql
-- Leverage clustering keys in joins
SELECT c.customer_name, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id  -- clustered column
WHERE c.customer_tier = 'ENTERPRISE'  -- clustered column
AND o.order_date >= '2024-01-01';  -- clustered column
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### 1. **Query Result Caching**
```sql
-- Snowflake automatically caches results for 24 hours
-- No configuration needed
-- Subsequent identical queries return instantly
```

### 2. **Warehouse Auto-Suspend**
```sql
-- Our configuration
CREATE WAREHOUSE analytics_wh
WITH 
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60          -- Suspend after 1 minute of inactivity
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE         -- Auto-resume on query
    MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1      -- Start with 1 cluster
    MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3;     -- Scale up to 3 clusters
```

### 3. **Resource Monitoring**
```sql
-- Monitor warehouse usage
SELECT 
    warehouse_name,
    avg_running,
    avg_queued_load,
    avg_queued_provisioning,
    avg_blocked
FROM information_schema.warehouse_load_history
WHERE warehouse_name = 'ANALYTICS_WH'
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔧 Maintenance Tasks

### 1. **Clustering Maintenance**
```sql
-- Check if tables need reclustering
SELECT 
    table_name,
    average_depth,
    average_overlaps
FROM information_schema.automatic_clustering_history
WHERE average_depth > 5 OR average_overlaps > 10;

-- Manual reclustering (if needed)
ALTER TABLE orders RECLUSTER;
```

### 2. **Search Optimization Maintenance**
```sql
-- Monitor search optimization build progress
SELECT 
    table_name,
    credits_used,
    num_files_built
FROM information_schema.search_optimization_history
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```

### 3. **Performance Monitoring Queries**
```sql
-- Create monitoring view for query performance
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW performance_monitoring AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', start_time) as query_hour,
    warehouse_name,
    COUNT(*) as query_count,
    AVG(execution_time) as avg_execution_time,
    AVG(queued_provisioning_time) as avg_queue_time,
    SUM(bytes_scanned) as total_bytes_scanned,
    AVG(partitions_scanned/partitions_total*100) as avg_partition_efficiency
FROM information_schema.query_history
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', start_time), warehouse_name
ORDER BY query_hour DESC;
```

## 📈 Expected Performance Gains

### With Our Optimization Strategy:

1. **Job Queries**: 70-90% faster filtering by status and date
2. **Customer Analytics**: 60-80% faster segmentation queries
3. **Product Catalog**: 50-75% faster category-based searches
4. **Order Analysis**: 80-95% faster customer order history
5. **Point Lookups**: 90-99% faster with search optimization

### Before vs After Example:
```sql
-- Before optimization: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 'CUST001';
-- Typical performance: 5-10 seconds on large table

-- After clustering: Efficient partition pruning
-- Same query: 100-500ms
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **No Traditional Indexes**: Snowflake's architecture makes them unnecessary
2. **Clustering Keys**: Use for large tables with predictable access patterns
3. **Search Optimization**: Enable for tables with point lookups
4. **Automatic Optimization**: Snowflake handles most optimization automatically
5. **Monitor Performance**: Use built-in views to track and optimize
